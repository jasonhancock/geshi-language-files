The puppet.php geshi language file found here is an update to one originally
found at http://www.mague.com/files/puppet.php

The pull_puppet_keywords.pl script parses the online puppet documentation and
generates some output that you can then copy/paste into the puppet.php to keep
your keywords up to date. You need to have perl and wget installed for this
script to work. To run the script, simply run:

./pull_puppet_keywords.pl
